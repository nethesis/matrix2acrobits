        Sends an outgoing message on behalf of a user.

        The `from` field can be:
        - A full Matrix ID (e.g., @user:server.com) - used directly
        - A phone number (e.g., +1234567890) - resolved to Matrix ID via -to-Matrix mapping if available

        If a phone number is provided and a mapping exists, the message is sent on behalf of the mapped Matrix user.
        If a phone number is provided but no mapping exists, the phone number is used as the sender ID.

        **File Attachments:**
        To send files, set `content_type` to `application/x-acro-filetransfer+json` and provide the 
        file transfer JSON in the `body` field. See the FileTransferMessage schema for the format.
        Matrix media URLs (mxc://) must already be uploaded to the Matrix content repository.

        Authentication is handled by the Application Service backend; the `password` field is ignored.
